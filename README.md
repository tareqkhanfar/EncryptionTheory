# Steganography Encryption

Steganography Encryption is a Python-based project that allows users to hide data in images using the LSB algorithm.
The project includes a user-friendly interface that enables users to select the file containing the secret message and the image to be used for the embedding process.

The project also includes a signature generation algorithm that can be used to verify the authenticity of the message.
The algorithm calculates the number of ones and zeros in the stegno image and then finds the multiplication between them to generate a signature.

# Features

Hide data in images using the LSB algorithm
Select the file containing the secret message and the image for the embedding process
Generate a signature to verify the authenticity of the message
User-friendly interface

# Usage 
To use Steganography Encryption, simply select the file containing the secret message and the image to be used for the embedding process.
The project will automatically hide the message in the image using the LSB algorithm and generate a signature for the stegno image.

To verify the authenticity of the message, the receiver can use the signature generation algorithm to calculate the number of ones 
and zeros in the stegno image and find the multiplication between them. If the result matches the signature provided by the sender, then the message is considered 
authentic.

# Conclusion
Steganography Encryption is a useful tool for hiding data in images and verifying the authenticity of the message. Whether you're a security analyst, investigator, or researcher, Steganography Encryption can help you protect your sensitive data and ensure that your messages are authentic.
